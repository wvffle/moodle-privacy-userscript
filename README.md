# moodle-privacy-userscript
So basically, the moodle instances I'm forced to use tracks visibility API and/or focus/blur events on window. I simply wanted to disable them :)  

## Installation
- Install [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)(Firefox only), [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- Go to [raw version](https://github.com/wvffle/moodle-privacy-userscript/raw/main/moodle-privacy.user.js) of the script
- Edit the script and add new `@include` or `@match` rules
